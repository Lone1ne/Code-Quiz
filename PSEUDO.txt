// We will need a timer to start when the "Start Quiz" button is clicked.
// So, we need some event listener on the button for a click to a function called "startQuiz".

// We need a function to start the quiz which will call the timer function.

// The timer function should start at 75 and count down by 1 every second.

// We need some way to fetch and display a random question.

// We need an event listener for when the correct answer is clicked.
// Upon a correct click, display "correct" and move to the next question.
// If the clicked answer is wrong, display "wrong", subtract 10 seconds, and move to the next question.

// We need something to keep track and store correct answers.

// When the time is up, we should display a screen with their total correct answers.
// They should be presented with an input field to enter their initials.

// When the "Submit" button is clicked (this needs an event listener), we should add their initials to the highscore array.
