## Description

The Code Quiz is a web application to test your knowledge on JavaScript fundamentals. You will be presented with a series of questions and multiple-choice answers.

Each correct answer will increase your score, while each incorrect answer will take 10 seconds from the clock. Once all questions have been answered or time runs out, the game is over. At this point, you can save your score with your initials, which will be displayed on the highscores page.
